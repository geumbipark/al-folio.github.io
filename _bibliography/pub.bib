  title={Minimum Wage, Employment, and Margins of Adjustment: Evidence from Employer--Employee Matched Panel Data},
  author={Lee, Jungmin, and Geumbi Park},
  abstract={We decompose the employment effect of the minimum wage into changes in employment within continued establishments and changes due to the exits of establishments. 
  For small-sized establishments, we distinguish between other labor adjustment margins, such as hours worked, hiring, and separation at the individual level. 
  Using employer--employee matched panel data, we show that the magnitude and channels of the employment effect differ by establishment size and industry. 
  We find a negative effect of the minimum wage on employment growth, which is highly concentrated among small establishments. 
  In particular, in the food and lodging and manufacturing industries, a substantial part of the effect is driven by business closing.
